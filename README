I'm really very excited about AI and neural network's. Not only artificial, 
but I also very intersting about biolgical neural network and our brain.
So, I've decided to spend free time developing and implementing my own neural network from scratch.
I've a goal to implement it by using very low level language as C++ and implement all those stuff, like
batchnorm, backprop, weight Xavier init., etc.

Also in the future, I plan to speed up the neural network
by implementing the Strassen algorithm for matrix products
and using multithreaded programming.
